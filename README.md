# Ref2Sac
## This is my work about 5 years age!!!
### This soft package is used to cut data from field data recorded by REFTEK130. Initaily coding was for receiver function data preparation. It was written to directly get event data (SAC format) from the REF data archive.  

It is very simple python script and depends on some other progam which I will provide later.
 - [x] 1. travel time calulation program such as Taup or ttimes
 - [x] 2. REFTEK tools fetch and convert data
 - [ ] ?3. distaz, A little program to calculate distance and azimuth between two geographic points.
